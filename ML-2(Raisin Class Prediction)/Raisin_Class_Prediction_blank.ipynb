A total of 900 raisin grains were used, including 450 pieces from both varieties. These images were subjected to various stages of pre-processing and 7 morphological features were extracted. These features have been classified using three different artificial intelligence techniques.\n","\n","\n","Attribute Information:\n","\n","1. Area: Gives the number of pixels within the boundaries of the raisin.\n","2. Perimeter: It measures the environment by calculating the distance between the boundaries of the raisin and the pixels around it.\n","3. MajorAxisLength: Gives the length of the main axis, which is the longest line that can be drawn on the raisin.\n","4. MinorAxisLength: Gives the length of the small axis, which is the shortest line that can be drawn on the raisin.\n","5. Eccentricity: It gives a measure of the eccentricity of the ellipse, which has the same moments as raisins.\n","6. ConvexArea: Gives the number of pixels of the smallest convex shell of the region formed by the raisin.\n","7.
